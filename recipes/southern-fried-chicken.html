    <h3>What is Southern Fried Chicken?</h3>
    Southern fried chicken is a popular dish in the southern United States, especially in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. It's made by coating chicken pieces in a mixture of flour, spices, and seasonings, then deep-frying them until they are golden brown and crispy. The result is a delicious, juicy chicken that is crispy on the outside and full of flavor. The dish is often served with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, biscuits, and gravy, and is a staple of traditional Southern cuisine.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
