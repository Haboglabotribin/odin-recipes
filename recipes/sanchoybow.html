    <h3>What is San Choy Bow?</h3>
    San Choy Bow is a Chinese dish that originated in the Sichuan province of China. It is a type of lettuce wrap that is typically filled with a mixture of ground meat (such as beef, pork, or chicken), vegetables (such as mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and water chestnuts), and a flavorful sauce. The filling is spooned onto a lettuce leaf, which is then wrapped around the mixture to form a bite-sized package. San Choy Bow is often served as an appetizer or a main dish, and is prized for its combination of flavors and textures. The dish is also a popular street food in many Asian countries, and has become popular in Western countries as well.
