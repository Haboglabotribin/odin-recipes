    <h3>What is Apple Pie?</h3>
    Apple pie is a type of dessert pie that is typically made by filling a pastry crust with sliced apples that have been sweetened and spiced. The pie is often baked in an oven until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly. It is a classic dessert that is popular in many countries, including the United States, where it is often served during holidays such as Thanksgiving.
    <p>
    The ingredients for an apple pie typically include a pastry crust, apples, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, and butter. Some recipes may also include additional ingredients like brown sugar, cornstarch, or raisins, to add extra flavor and texture. Apple pie can be served hot or cold, and is often topped with a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe for pie dough (enough for a double-crust pie)</li>
        <li>6-7 cups of thinly sliced apples (about 6-7 medium apples)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>2 tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)</li>
        <li>Coarse sugar, for sprinkling (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to  190°C / 375°F. Line a 9-inch pie dish with one of the pie dough rounds.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the sliced apples, sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon juice.</li>
        <li>Pour the apple mixture into the prepared pie dish and dot the top with the butter.</li>
        <li>Roll out the remaining pie dough to form a top crust. Place the top crust over the apples, trim any excess dough, and crimp the edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Brush the top of the pie with the beaten egg and sprinkle with coarse sugar, if desired.</li>
        <li>Place the pie on a baking sheet and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the pie cool completely before serving. Serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
